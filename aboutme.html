  <p> Hi! I am Shivani Chandrasekaran, and I'm going to be a senior at Edison High School.  I came to Girls Who Code to get exposure to the tech field.  In my time here,
    I've come to learn so many things I never knew before.  This experience has broadened my horizons, and pushed me to pursue Computer Science in college.  I'm so thankful to have got this
incredible oppurtunity!   </p>

    but i never realized what was making my computer work. When I leanred about coding languages I really wanted to take a course and one of my friends recommnded
    Girls Who Code! I'm so glad to have been able to spend my summer here and it has been a great overall experience meeting girls who have similar interest to me. </p>

  <p> Hi, I am Amanda Jones. I am 16 years old and I am going to be a junior from Wayne, New Jersey. Before entering the Girls Who Code Summer
    Immersion Program, I had taken a basic coding program at my highschool in sophmore year. That got me interested in things like computer science. Now, after
    expriencing the program, I know so much more and can do so much more. Thanks to this experience I know I want to go into the STEM field, possibly
    engineering and have met so many incredible people. </p>
